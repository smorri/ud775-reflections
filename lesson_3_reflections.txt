When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    It is more convenient to use a remote repository because it creates an easier access to your files, without the user using the same     machine. It is also more convenient when multiple users to access the repository from their own locations remotely, rather than in 1 setting using the same machines.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If we relied on automatic pulls, we may pull data from Github much too frequently. It is best to only pull changs when we actually need them (ie when we need to update some code, or when we need pull the latest version from the Github servers).
