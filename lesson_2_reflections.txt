What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You initialize a repository by navigating to a directory that does not contain the .git file. Then you run 'git init'. These creates the .git file in the directory. No commits have been initialized yet. But now the directory is transformed into a Git Repository.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is an intermediate area between a commit and the working directory. It is a temporary holding cell before final commits are made.
